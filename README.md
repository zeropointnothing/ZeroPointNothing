## Proud Creations

- WHAT LURKS WITHIN: An interactive novel experience, where your choices matter. My first game!!
- ZRpB (PSOMI) : A Discord "proxy" bot to aid in the writing experience. Only available on my community server.
- koulouri : A Python music player that aims to be simple, lightweight, and functional.
- synthLength : An "online radio" written in Python.
- "PyVPN" : A VPN created entirely in Python. (not publicly available, *yet*)
- jPowder: A fun (though basic) little powder simulation game made in Java.
- And more!

## Contact

The best way to contact me is over Discord at either `@zeropointnothing` or `@zer0pointnothing`(alt). If I'm not busy or asleep, I should get to you pretty quickly.

I'm also the owner of a small (though passionate) writing community on Discord. Interested? Ask me about it!

## Programming

I write programs mainly in Python due to my love of OOP and the language's flexibilty compared to most other languages. However, I'm currently experimenting with the Java langauge as well!

Mostly driven by boredom and my extreme lack of things to do, I often mess around with topics that I'm currently interested in. This tends to lead to things such as [synthLength](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/radio) or [jPowder](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/jpowder) being born simply for the sake of creating them.

Alternatively, I like to create applications that just make life easier for myself or other people. [koulouri](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/koulouri) is a perfect example—a music player I made solely because I couldn't find another one I liked for the Arch Linux platform. If you are intrested in any of my projects, I would check these out first, as they're the most polished and are likely the least buggy.

## Writing

_Currently working on Betwixt Chains. Stay tuned!_
