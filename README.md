## Proud Creations

- WHAT LURKS WITHIN: An interactive novel experience, where your choices matter. My first game!!
- ZRpB (PSOMI) : A Discord "proxy" bot to aid in the writing experience. Only available on my community server.
- koulouri : A Python music player that aims to be simple, lightweight, and functional.
- synthLength : An "online radio" written in Python.
- "PyVPN" : A VPN created entirely in Python. (not publicly available, *yet*)
- jPowder: A fun (though basic) little powder simulation game made in Java.
- And more!

## Contact

The best way to contact me is over Discord at either `@zeropointnothing` or `@zer0pointnothing`(alt). If I'm not busy or asleep, I should get to you pretty quickly.

I'm also the owner of a small (though passionate) writing community on Discord. Interested? Ask me about it!

## Writing

Unfortunately, I don't have anything writing related published yet. Stay tuned, though!
