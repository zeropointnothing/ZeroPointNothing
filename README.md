Programmer, writer, and music lover.

~ *zeropointnothing, exii* ~

## Proud Creations

- ZRpB (PSOMI.v2) : A Discord "proxy" bot to aid in the writing experience. Only available on my community server.
- koulouri : A Python music player that aims to be simple, lightweight, and functional.
- koulouri_c : A simple and lightweight music player, rewritten from the ground up.
- YADG (Yet Another Disaster Game) : As the title suggests, a basic Disaster Survival game in Roblox!
- "PyVPN" : A VPN created entirely in Python. (not publicly available, *yet*)
- jPowder: A fun (though basic) little powder simulation game made in Java.
- And more!

## Contact

The best way to contact me is over Discord at either `@zeropointnothing` or `@zer0pointnothing`(alt). If I'm not busy or asleep, I should get to you pretty quickly.

I'm also the owner of a small (though passionate) writing community on Discord. Interested? Ask me about it!

## Programming

Computing is built on the shoulders of giants. Personally? I think those shoulders are quite messy.

Although most of my projects are just for fun ([jPowder](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/jpowder), [synthLength](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/radio)) and are typically nothing much, I often write software because the options available to us are, to be blunt, not very good.

Most of my projects are written in Python, but in my dedication to create better sofware that empowers more than just me, I've moved onto to better and deeper languages such as Java and C++.

Whether it's something as simple as a music player ([koulouri](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/koulouri)/[koulouri_c](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/koulouri_c)) or something big like a Discord bot ([PSOMI.v2(zrpb)](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/psomi)), I want to build a better future where code is functional, well documented, and useful. For all people involved.

## Writing

I've been writing for... quite a while now. Although most of it has been contained within Discord community servers, the skills I've learned over the years have brought me very far, and that passion hasn't died yet.

I write all of my stories in a 'Fantasy/Sci-Fi' universe named Arcallis, a land filled with magic, futuristic tech, and a whole lotta tension between its people. It's quite the expansive setting, leaving it with plenty of room to breathe and grow, and hopefully plenty of exciting stuff for you to read!

I'm currently working on my novel,  _Betwixt Chains_, and a Wattpad story (basically still a novel, just on the web ;) ), _flicker._, both of which are currently a work in progress. Stay tuned!
